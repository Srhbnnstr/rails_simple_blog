# homework submission

**You will submit this file, edited, as your homework**

* As you build your app, keep `homework.md` open.  
* Each time you run a new `rake ...` or `rails ...` command, jot it down in homework.md.  
* Describe what each command does.  If it has arguments, what do they mean?
  * An example is provided below.
